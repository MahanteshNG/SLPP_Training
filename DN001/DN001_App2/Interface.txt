Interface: 

Multiple or Hybrid Inheritance is not directly supported by class concept in Java and C#.

So if you want to have multiple or hybrid inheritance concept in C# or Java, we can do so by using
interface.

Interface is not a class but a contract;ie, a collection of rules which are to be implemented by child
classes [otherwise compiler will generate error].

Interface is purely virtual [ie it will never contain any method with implementation].

We can not create an object of interface.

***Can not use any public or private or any other access specificiers to declare interface method.
