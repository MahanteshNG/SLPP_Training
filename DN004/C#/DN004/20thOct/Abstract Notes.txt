Abstract Class and Abstract Method:

A method is defined abstract if it does not contain any defination under declaring class[ie, the method
will contain only declaration but not body].

The Class which contains the abstract method has also to be abstract [ie we can not declare an
abstract method under a non abstract class].

Use abstract to declare an abstract class and abstract method.

Apart from abstract methods; we can have normal methods and properties under abstract class.

We can not create any instance [ie object] of abstract class.

abstract class Game
{
abstract void Play();
}

All abstract methods of abstract class has to be implemented by child class; otherwise compiler
will raise an error.
