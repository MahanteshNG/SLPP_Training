Exceptions are run time bugs which occur due to incorrect user input while program is executing
which causes the abrupt termination of program.

Exception Handlers are employed by developers to handle these runtime exceptions so that the
program does not crashes and also the users are notified about the problems.

Exception Handling blocks:
try
{
//contains the code protion which can raise an exception
}
catch
{
//contains message for user if exception occurs
}

**All types of exceptions in C# derive from base Exception Class.
Example of Exceptions: DivideByZero,FormatException,FileNotFound etc.
